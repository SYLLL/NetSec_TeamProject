Server that doesn't communicate using PLS: 20174.1.1337.2
ParallelTSP communicates with this server by just sending GetMobileCodeStatus
using a different port number everytime.

We want to detect these messages and send false responses.

TODO:

Write a demux that will listen on traffic going from
20174.1.1337.1 to 20174.1.1337.2

Check to see that it is a GetMobileCodeStatus packet.
- get the cookie number
If it is, send back a GetMobileCodeStatusResponse packet
- use the same cookie number
- set complete to be True
- set the runtime to be arbitrary
