Goal:
Try to initiate a session with a server without having the private key.


Flag 3:
Server 20174.1.1337.6 is using the same PreKey:
b'\x98\xb8\xa4j\xd3\xf4\xe9\x18\xf5\xa0r\xa8\xe2\xb3\x8eW'

How the exploit works:
We pretend to be one of seth's servers. We pick 20174.1.1337.4 to impersonate.
We perform a normal handshake with this server in order to get the right certificates.
Once we get the certificates, we create a fake vnic, then send those certificates to
20174.1.1337.6. We continue as normal, but since we do not have the key for the PKs
sent to us, we use the value above as the PKs since we expect it to be the same.
